Hey there! Welcome to my new website. I've been meaning to build something that felt more *me* for a while, and I finally got around to it.

## Why a New Site?

I wanted a space that was:

- **Actually mine** — not just a profile on someone else's platform
- **Easy to update** — blog posts in Markdown, simple to maintain
- **Aesthetically on brand** — vaporwave meets retro-tech, because that's just who I am

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Developer tools and AI** — it's literally my job, and I have Opinions™
- **Tech and media** — the intersection of technology and culture
- **Random thoughts** — whatever else is on my mind

## The Tech Stack

For the curious, this site is built with:

- **Astro** — fast, modern static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** — for the styling
- **GitHub Pages** — free hosting that just works

Feel free to poke around, check out my [projects](/projects), or learn more [about me](/about).

Catch you later! ✨
