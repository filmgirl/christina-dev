I'm Christina Warren, and I work in Developer Relations at [GitHub](https://github.com). I've previously worked at Google DeepMind and Microsoft and in a past life, I was a journalist at website's such as Gizmodo and Mashable, and was a frequent guest on CNN, CNBC, MSNBC Fox Business, Bloomberg, and other networks.

At heart, I'm a writer and storyteller who loves technology and finding ways to make complex topics accessible and engaging. Over the years, I've written thousdands of articles, produced video content, and spoken at conferences around the world about technology, developer tools, AI, and the intersection of tech and culture.

## Professional Background

I spend my days building tools and content that help developers succeed. I'm obsessed with tech, open source software, and finding ways to bridge the gap between complex technology and everyday users.

## Current Focus

- Working on GitHub Copilot and AI-powered developer tools
- Creating content about developer productivity
- Building community and helping developers succeed with GitHub's platform

## Personal Interests

I'm obsessed with tech, media, and pop culture. My current special interests are: The Pitt, Fallout, AI dev tools, the never-ending drama surrounding whoever the fuck owns Warner Bros., and of course, Taylor Swift.
