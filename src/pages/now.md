This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

*Last updated: January 30, 2026*

## Work

I recently rejoined GitHub, after about a year at Google DeepMind. What can I say, GitHub is home. I'm a senior developer advocate, focusing on making GitHub the best place for developers. Modern software development inveitably means using AI tooling, so a lot of my work is focused on AI too.

## Current Projects

- Building out this personal site
- Keeping up with the latest AI trends and dev tools
- About to go on medical leave because I fucked up my cervical spine and need surgery (fun times!)

## Watching

- **The Pitt** — this was my favorite show of 2025 and I'm super stoked that we got a second season so fast.
- **Fallout** — my favorite show of 2024 returned for a second season. It's almost over, but it's still been great.
- **Industry** - HBO does the good shit, no matter what.

## Reading

- **Half His Age** - the debut novel by Jennett McCurdy
- **The Uncool** - Cameron Crowe's memoir

## Listening To

I'll eventually put a Spotify playlist here of my current discoverires.

## Location

📍 Seattle, WA
