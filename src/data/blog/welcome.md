Hey there! Welcome to my new website. I've been meaning to build something that felt more *me* for a while, and I finally got around to it.

## Why a New Site?

I wanted a space that was:

- **Actually mine** — not just a profile on someone else's platform
- **Easy to update** — blog posts in Markdown, simple to maintain
- **Clean and readable** — good typography, dark mode support

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Developer tools and AI** — it's literally my job, and I have Opinions™
- **Tech and media** — the intersection of technology and culture
- **Random thoughts** — whatever else is on my mind

## The Tech Stack

For the curious, this site is built with:

- **Astro** with the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme
- **Tailwind CSS** — for the styling
- **GitHub Pages** — free hosting that just works

Feel free to poke around, check out my [about page](/about), or browse the [blog](/blog).

Catch you later! ✨
